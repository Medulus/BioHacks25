# Inspiration

The inspiration behind this project comes from the need for personalized cancer immunotherapy. With the complexity of cancer biology and the vast amount of genomic and functional data available, there is a critical need to systematically analyze and interpret this data to recommend effective therapies. The database provides a foundation for building a machine learning-driven recommendation system that bridges the gap between raw data and actionable therapeutic insights.

# What it does

The system uses multiple datasets to recommend personalized cancer immunotherapies. It identifies relevant immunotherapy targets based on tumor-specific gene expression, filters therapies based on pathogenic variants, incorporates target interactions to predict immune responses, and maps targets to FDA-approved or experimental drugs. The goal is to provide clinicians and researchers with a data-driven tool to optimize therapy selection for individual patients.

# How we built it

The system uses multiple datasets to recommend personalized cancer immunotherapies. It identifies relevant immunotherapy targets based on tumor-specific gene expression, filters therapies based on pathogenic variants, incorporates target interactions to predict immune responses, and maps targets to FDA-approved or experimental drugs. The goal is to provide clinicians and researchers with a data-driven tool to optimize therapy selection for individual patients.

We used machine learning algorithms to analyze and interpret the data, creating a recommendation system that synthesizes these datasets into actionable insights.

# Challenges we ran into
Data Integration: Combining different datasets with varying formats and levels of detail was a significant challenge.

Resistance Mutations: Identifying and excluding therapies targeting genes with resistance-conferring mutations required careful filtering and validation.

Predictive Accuracy: Ensuring the accuracy of immune response predictions based on MHC-peptide-TCR interactions was complex due to the variability in immune system behavior.

Scalability: Handling large-scale genomic and functional data while maintaining computational efficiency was a hurdle.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
Successfully integrating multiple datasets to create a comprehensive therapy recommendation system.

Developing a machine learning model that accurately prioritizes therapies based on tumor-specific data.

Creating a tool that can potentially improve patient outcomes by minimizing off-target effects and maximizing therapeutic efficacy.

Validating drug-target interactions using the DGIdb Associations dataset to ensure the reliability of recommendations.
